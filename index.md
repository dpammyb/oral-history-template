## Founding Member of the KCC:    An Oral Account

This video clip features the oral performance of forty-eight-year-old guide, Chewang Bhutia, a founding member of the [Khangchengdzonga Conservation Committee (KCC).](http://www.baliparafoundation.com/en/blog/khanchendzonga-conservation-committee-kcc) The power of his voice invokes a sense of the triumph of the development, progress, and success thus far of the KCC.

Bhutia’s testimonial of the founding of the KCC makes him a living witness who helps connect the past to the present. He explains that the tourists appeared to be having a negative impact on Sikkim’s [Khangchengdzonga National park.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D3PxKq4BMY) In 1996, he and a small group of locals got together to investigate this negative impact (01:09). Their findings led to [trackers](http://sikenvis.nic.in/WriteReadData/UserFiles/Trek-Route.jpg) switch to kerosene stoves from firewood for the preparation of food (04:45). A movement that saw an increase in revenue for guides and porters who, after a year, took over the rental of stoves from the KCC founders. This use of plastic was also an issue resulting from food prep so the group went to local shop keepers to discuss a ban on plastics and were successful. The government, aware of these initiatives, passed a law in 1997 banning plastics in all of Sikkim (04:19). They were encouraged to create a [formal group](http://www.pawanchamling.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/International-Conference-on-Conservation-of-Natural-and-Cultural-Values-of-Khangchendzonga-National-Park.jpg) which they did with the help of the Mountain Institute in 1996 (01:48).

The formation of this group started with a dialogue which demonstrates the persuasive power of the spoken word to affect change. Their study of tourist behavior led to positive changes in the local economy. In addition to the rental of kerosene stoves (4:54), locals can increase their earnings through off season farming (7:35) and the [homestay project.](http://kccsikkim.weebly.com/uploads/4/4/0/5/44058595/110590.jpg?209) (9:37) These empower both farms and women (11:09) while improving the [local economy.](http://kccsikkim.weebly.com/uploads/4/4/0/5/44058595/6835315.jpg)

But the KCC does not stop there, as Bhutia explains, the future of the KCC is to expand through teaching future generations. Members of the KCC [teach school children](http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/thumbs/site_1513_0012-360-360-20161019150900.jpg) and teachers about conservation (9:25). They lead by example and it is the practice of what they preach that has the biggest impact. He explains, you must give the people incentive so they will listen (17:03). Explaining to them the benefits of conserving the park is to [keep tourists coming back.](http://kccsikkim.weebly.com/uploads/4/4/0/5/44058595/4551396.jpg?434) Tourists have money to go anywhere but the people in the community do not (17:28). Educating locally especially through children is the key to broadening the positive influence of the KCC on ecotourism. Teaching children through interactive games that the children share with their families (17:54). Teaching children, guides, porters, and tourists who in turn share what they learn is how information spreads.

Spreading of knowledge through teaching conservation is ensuring the Khangchengdzonga National Park will be enjoyed by future generations. The KCC has shown how a conversation can lead to great accomplishment.


<!--including _markup_ of **various kinds**. Now you can just write! But you should be aware of a couple of advanced features of markdown
- you can embed HTML directly in a markdown file. This is great if you want to add complex attributes like **classes**, e.g. to your `img` tags so that they display properly.
  - another use of embedded HTML is for funky javascript function links. I've written a simple function that will seek to a particular time code in seconds.  You can call it like this: `<a href="javascript:seek(75)">seek to 1:15</a>`, but `[seek to 1:15](javascript:seek(75))` won't render properly, so you have to type the whole link in, as seen here: <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(75)"> seek to 1:15</a>.
  - also, Remarkable supports pandoc-style footnotes, which can be helpful sometimes. Here are some examples of footnotes at work:-->
